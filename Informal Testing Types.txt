Informal Testing types:-->


What is Exploratory Testing?
	Usually, this process will be carried out by domain experts. 
	They perform testing just by exploring the functionalities 
	of the application without having the knowledge of the requirements.

What is Monkey Testing?
	Perform abnormal action on the application deliberately in order 
	to verify the stability of the application.

Adhoc testing:-->

	Ad-hoc testing is quite opposite to the formal testing. It is an informal 
	testing type.In Adhoc testing, testers randomly test the application 
	without following any documents and test design techniques

Gorilla Testing:-->
	
	perform repeated testing on perticular module/function in order to check
	stability of application

==================================================================
System Intergration Testing:-->
	Also know  as component integration testing or End to End system testing.
	=> Some times requirements are design to use in different state of softwarE
	   then testing team need to verify the requirement are functioning
	   everywhere client expected it to be.
==================================================================
What are the principles of Software Testing?
	1. Testing shows presence of defects.
	2. Exhaustive testing is impossible
	3. Early testing
	4. Defect clustering
	5. Pesticide Paradox
	6. Testing is context depending
	


1. What is Exhaustive Testing?
	Testing all the functionalities using all valid and invalid inputs 
	and preconditions is known as Exhaustive testing.

2. What is Early Testing?
	Defects detected in early phases of SDLC are less expensive to fix. 
	So conducting early testing reduces the cost of fixing defects.

3. What is Defect clustering?
	Defect clustering in software testing means that a small module or 
	functionality contains most of the bugs or it has the most operational 
	failures.

4. What is Pesticide Paradox?
	Pesticide Paradox in software testing is the process of repeating the same test
	again and again, eventually, the same test cases will no longer find new defects.
	So to overcome this Pesticide Paradox, it is necessary to review the test
	cases regularly and add or update them to find more defects.

5. What is Defect Cascading in Software Testing?
	Defect cascading in Software testing means triggering of other defects
	in an application. When a defect is not identified or goes unnoticed while 
	testing, it invokes other defects. 
	It leads to multiple defects in the later stages and results.			in an increase in a number of defects in the application.
